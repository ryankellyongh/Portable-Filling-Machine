# Portable-Filling-Machine
This project focuses on designing a Portable Manual Liquid Filling Machine for laboratory, field, and small-batch industrial use. The device addresses the limitations of existing filling methods, which are often slow, inconsistent, and prone to spills when using funnels, syringes, or pipettes. Unlike large-scale filling machines that are costly and non-portable, this design prioritizes efficiency, precision, affordability, and mobility.
How It Works
Fill: Remove the top fill cap, pour liquid into the chamber, and replace the cap.


Position: Place the container under the nozzle, using the side handle for stability.


Dispense: Push the plunger to release liquid through the nozzle.


Clean: Disassemble parts, rinse, and dry after use.



Design Features & Goals
Quick Operation: One-handed plunger action; accurate filling for 10 mL to 100 mL.


Interchangeable Nozzles: Snap-on options for test tubes, bottles, or vials.


Easy Cleaning: All fluid-contact parts snap apart for maintenance.


Cost Efficiency: Target price under $100/unit using common, durable materials.


Material Summary:
Housing & Reservoir: Polycarbonate


Frame & Lever: ABS


Nozzles: Polypropylene or 316L Stainless Steel


Seals/Tubing: Silicone



Target Users
Academic Researchers & Lab Technicians: For precise, small-volume liquid handling in space-limited environments.


Field Scientists & Environmental Technicians: Portable design suited for mobile sampling in rugged conditions.


Small-Batch Manufacturers (Food, Cosmetics, Beverage): Affordable filling solution for QA sampling or boutique production.


Healthcare & Veterinary Professionals: Assists in dosing and sample preparation for clinics or on-site visits.


Why This Device?
Existing machines are large and costly, making them impractical for small-scale operations. This device combines portability and precision, filling a crucial gap for users who need an affordable, flexible, and hygienic solution.

Safety & Maintenance
Safety: Inspect seals before use; do not exceed fill limits; stop if any part is damaged.


Maintenance: Regular cleaning; check alignment of guide rods; replace worn seals and fasteners as needed.
